## What is this project?

**Lefi Digital Brain** is a web application built using modern frontend technologies. Its main goal is to manage, visualize, and interact with weekly routines. The project follows a modular architecture with reusable components to support scalability and maintainability.

---

## What does it currently do?

* Displays and/or manages weekly routines using components like `WeeklyRoutineTimeline` and `WeeklyRoutineView`.
* Provides a modular and scalable base for agile frontend development.
* Utilizes modern development features such as hot module replacement and fast builds.

---

## Current limitations

* ❌ No backend integration or data persistence.
* ❌ No user authentication or authorization.
* ❌ No complex business logic or global state management implemented.
* ❌ No automated tests.
* ❌ No external API documentation (if any exist).

---

## 🧱 Tech stack

* **Vite**: Lightning-fast build tool.
* **React + TypeScript**: Modern UI with static typing.
* **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling framework.
* **Modular structure** in `/src/components/modules`.

**Key dependencies (tentative):**

* React Router (to be confirmed)
* Zustand / Redux (optional for state management)
* Other possible: Axios, React Query, etc.
